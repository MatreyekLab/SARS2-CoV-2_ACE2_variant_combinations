Pairs with Anna's comment, but it might be worth presenting a positional or running average sequence similarity (x axis = position, y = similarity) between the ACE2 constructs.  If changes are seemingly minor or not near interacting region, high variability may have limited impact on overall impact of high variability.

Given that at least half the paper and most of the literature deal with characterization of H. Sapiens is it worth highlighting the H.S. in 5A visually?
